<h2>States</h2>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Checked</dt>
<dd>If a check box is checked, it is the default selection, or the user has selected the check box.</dd>

<dt>Unchecked</dt>
<dd>If a check box is unchecked, it is not the default selection, and was not selected or was deselected by the user.</dd>

<dt>Indeterminate</dt>
<dd>In the case of a 3 state check box where there are nested check boxes, the indeterminate state occurs when the state of all of the children check boxes are not all checked or all unchecked.  In this case, the user can cycle the state of the check box between the 3 states.</dd>

<dt>Disabled</dt>
<dd>If a check box is disabled, the user cannot select it. Often times, a user must complete another action first, for example, choose a prerequisite, before a check box is enabled. A disabled check box can be checked or unchecked. When a disabled check box controls other UI elements, disable the dependent elements.
