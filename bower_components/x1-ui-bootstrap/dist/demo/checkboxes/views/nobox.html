<h2>Alternative 'No-box' Check Box Style</h2>

<p>Traditionally, check boxes are check marks that appear inside a box.  Hence the name.  However more modern styling has been used that does not include the box part of the check box.  The styling on the 'no-box' check boxes applies just to the check mark itself, and relies on surrounding context to provide additional visual cues (such as hover background color changes).
</p>
<p>No-check check boxes can be used in tables to prevent them from being too busy visually, and in drop-down lists if the real estate is limited.
</p>
<p>Styling for this type of check box has not been finalized.</p>
