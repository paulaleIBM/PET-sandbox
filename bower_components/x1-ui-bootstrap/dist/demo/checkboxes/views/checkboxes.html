<h2>What they're for...</h2>

<p>A check box is a way for a user to choose one or more items from a group of item when it is important for the user to be able to see the choices available and what they've chosen. Because all choices are visible to the user, this is best used when there are less than 10 items to choose from.</p>
		<ul>
        <li>When using a single check box, the checked and unchecked states must be mutually exclusive. If there is any room for ambiguity, use radio buttons instead.</li>
        <li>When you use check boxes in groups, the user chooses between a set of items, typically between six and eight items. The user is not required to choose any item. You can include more than eight items if there is adequate space and the user would benefit from seeing all the items at one time.</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>The default state of a check box should be the most common or least risky option.</li>
        <li>If a user might want to choose all of the check boxes in a group, include a Select All /Deselect All  function at the top of the group. </li>
        <li>List the most important item first, unless there is a more natural or logical order. Or you can use alphabetical order.</li>
        <li>Provide a label for a check box group.</li>
        <li>Use sentence style capitalization for the check box labels and for a group label.</li>
        </ul>
