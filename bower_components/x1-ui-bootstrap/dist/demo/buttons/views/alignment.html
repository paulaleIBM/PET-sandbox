<h2 class="page-header">Button Alignment</h2>
<p class="lead">Buttons can be aligned with other elements in a UI in various ways. Consistent
	alignment helps
	promote the sense of quality and continuity, and lessens visual distraction to the user.</p>
<p>Note: This guideline deals with form submission (and cancel) buttons, and no other toolbar or
	action buttons.</p>
<p>There are two main types of button alignments:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Inline form buttons, which are left-aligned.</li>
	<li>Modal window buttons, which are right-aligned.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both of these options, the primary button is always to the left of secondary buttons; Cancel
	is always the right-most button.</p>

<h3>Left Alignment</h3>
<p>Left alignment is used for inline forms, and not web modal window (dialog box) forms. Place
	buttons at the end of the form, and ensure that the buttons are left-aligned with the sentence
	start position. </p>
<p>This practice has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Consistent with web trends and rich-client convention.</li>
	<li>Consistent with eye scanning patterns that occur from left to right at the end of the
		form.</li>
	<li>Aligns with other toolbar buttons that may appear elsewhere when the inline form appears on
		a page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Right Alignment</h3>
<p>Right align buttons for web modal windows (dialog boxes) in the lower right corner of the window.
	If the user reduces the window size, the button moves in so that it is not scrolled out of
	view.</p>
<p>This practice has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provides a consistent experience of reading primary actions first as found in inline
		forms.</li>
	<li>Users see the primary action as they read left to right, to save time, and avoid errors.</li>
	<li>Follows the Windows interaction, which is still in use by the majority of people.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Button placement</h2>
<h3>Top Button Placement</h3>
<p>Buttons should be placed on the bottom of most forms, however there are special cases allowing
	for variations.</p>
<p>Buttons may be placed above a form when the form includes inputs, where one or more input is
	exceedingly long (requires scrolling to reach the end), such as a rich text editor, or other
	input where a long input response is allowed. It is also allowed if a form is exceedingly long,
	and the inputs at the top are the ones most commonly used, where the following inputs are
	optional, or not expected to be used often. This occurs commonly in edit forms, where a user may
	only need to interact with a few of the fields at the top of the form. In cases such as these,
	the buttons may be placed above the form.</p>
<p>When top placement is used, the buttons can be repeated at the bottom if desired, if the
	scrolling required to view the end of the form hides the buttons at the top. It is also
	permissible to lock the buttons at the top of a scrolling form so that they always remain in
	view. If this implementation is used, buttons should not be placed at the bottom of the form.</p>
<h3>Button Placement in Tabbed Forms or Wizards</h3>
<p>Some forms and form wizards have multiple tabs or steps, to combine similar content. Sometimes,
	the tabs have varying lengths due to the amount of content, and they may employ scroll bars
	within individual tabs, in order to keep the overall form the same size. In these cases, it is
	acceptable to lock the location of the buttons at the top or bottom, outside of the scrolling
	area, provided that the length of the overall form container fits within the view without
	scrolling.</p>
