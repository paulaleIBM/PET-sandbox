<h2>What they're for...</h2>
<p> Buttons are one of the most commonly used graphical user interface controls. 
They serve as obvious indicators that help users understand exactly what actions can be performed on the information they are viewing. 
</p>

<h2>Use when...</h2>
<p>Buttons are used as triggers for actions. Depending on the use case, buttons contain a combination of a clear label and, optionally, an icon.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Buttons bring attention to themselves by looking different from other components in the
    interface, and depending on their placement on the interface, different button types can be
    used.</p>
<p>Use of appropriate behavior and visual styling for buttons, helps users determine when an
    action can be used (enabled / disabled) and whether they are in a position to interact with
    a button. Users learn how to use an application more quickly when button type, style and
    label are used consistently.</p>
    
    <h3>A word on links versus buttons...</h3>
    <div>
        <button class="btn btn-default">Button</button>
        <a href="#here" name="here">Link</a>
    </div>
    <p>Buttons are preferred for actions with significant consequences. Always confirm before
    running actions with significant consequences.</p>
    <p>The Cancel function should always be a button, not a link, if it is located in the footer of a window.</p>
    <p>Buttons in general, are more easily seen and used than links. Use links instead of buttons for navigation to another page or help topic, and for inline and context-based actions that might otherwise appear as buttons (such as when space is limited, or there is a list action items). Where there is a set of actions in close proximity (for example, in a toolbar) they should all be represented consistently where possible.</p>
    <p>Only use a mixture of links and buttons alongside each other when the reason for this is
    evident â€” for example to save space, or to lend more weight to the more common action.
    Where links and buttons are used together, the user will interact with the link as if it
    were a button. Use a button for the more common action, and a link for the less common
    action.</p>
    <p>In some technologies, it is difficult to make the width of buttons dynamic, which
        increases the chance of truncation during translation. The button must then be made long
        enough for all translations, which could make for a button that is too long. Links on
        the other hand, do not have this issue. As well, because links usually use sentence
        style capitalization, and can include articles, the translation quality is improved. In
        most cases, where buttons and links are available, links should be given precedence to
        decrease translation costs. However, links must be placed within tables so that they
        wrap properly.</p>
