<h2 class="page-header">Overview</h2>
<p class="lead">Buttons are one of the most commonly used graphical user interface controls. They
	serve as
	obvious indicators that help users understand exactly what actions can be performed on the
	information they are viewing.</p>

<h2>Use when...</h2>
<p>Buttons are used as triggers for actions. Depending on the use case, buttons contain a
	combination of a clear label and, optionally, an icon.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Buttons bring attention to themselves by looking different from other components in the
	interface, and depending on their placement on the interface, different button types can be
	used.</p>
<p>Use of appropriate behavior and visual styling (enabled / disabled) for buttons helps users
	determine when an action can be used and whether they are in a position to interact with a
	button. Users learn how to use an application more quickly when button type, style and label
	are used consistently.</p>

<h3>A word on links versus buttons...</h3>
<div class="bs-example">
	<button class="btn btn-default">Button</button>
	<a class="btn btn-link">Link</a>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>Buttons are preferred for actions with significant consequences. Always confirm before
		running actions with significant consequences.</li>
	<li>The Cancel function should always be a button, not a link, if it is located in the footer
		of a window.</li>
	<li>Buttons in general, are more easily seen and used than links. Use links instead of
		buttons for navigation to another page or help topic, and for inline and context-based
		actions that might otherwise appear as buttons (such as when space is limited, or there
		is a list action items). Where there is a set of actions in close proximity (for example,
		in a toolbar) they should all be represented consistently where possible.</li>
	<li>Only use a mixture of links and buttons alongside each other when the reason
		for this is evident â€” for example to save space, or to lend more weight to the more
		common action. Where links and buttons are used together, the user will interact with the
		link as if it were a button. Use a button for the more common action, and a link for the
		less common action.</li>
	<li>In some technologies, it is difficult to make the width of buttons dynamic, which
		increases the chance of truncation during translation. The button must then be made long
		enough for all translations, which could make for a button that is too long. Links on
		the other hand, do not have this issue. As well, because links can include articles, the
		translation quality is improved. In most cases, where buttons and links are available,
		links should be given precedence to decrease translation costs. However, links must be
		placed within tables so that they wrap properly.</li>
