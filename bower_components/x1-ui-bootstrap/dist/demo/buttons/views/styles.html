<h2>Button styles</h2>
<p>Two padding styles are being defined in the button widgets: the 'default' will support the
	'airy' attribute of the X1 design signature, and 'compact' will support those products where
	real estate is still a premium, or where the page cannot be redesigned to use the 'default'
	style.</p>
