<h2 class="page-header">Labels</h2>
<p class="lead">Buttons must be labeled with text, a graphic, or both text and a graphic.</p>
<p>Generally, buttons need only a text label. Since buttons represent actions that the user can
	take, the text is usually the verb that is the action (for example, Add or Cancel). The text
	can also be the answer to a leading question, such as OK, Yes, or No in response to “Do you
	really want to do x?” If you need to use longer descriptive text, it should be placed outside
	the button.</p>
<p>Graphics include icons and other images. Graphics provide a visual indication of the action
	that can be performed. They are generally used on toolbars and for actions where the metaphor
	is familiar. See the Iconography section for information on using glyphicons on buttons and
	other user interface elements.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Consider combining text and graphics only when the graphic aids in comprehension, such as
		when it is a standard symbol for the command or helps users visualize the results of the
		command.</li>
	<li>If you are using a fixed-width button, the label text will wrap within that fixed size.
		If you are using a variable-width button, it will expand to the length of the text. In
		this case, be aware of the extra space required for translation to ensure that your
		buttons do not get overly long.</li>
	<li>Do not use text characters in button labels to represent arrows or other shapes.
		Characters used this way do not translate well. An example would be using < or > in an
		Add/Remove button.</li>
	<li>Use one-word button labels where possible. Avoid using more than three words on a button
		label.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not recommended to create buttons that have only an icon as a label. Mobile environments
	do not allow for tooltip support, and icons are not always intuitive and easy to understand.
	If you do use buttons that are labeled only with icons, consider adding text to the graphic
	when the graphic alone is not sufficiently self-explanatory, or in toolbars where there are
	so few buttons that each one can have its own text label. Combining text and graphics on a
	button is also useful where the graphic is used elsewhere in the product, and/or you want to
	help build recognition for a new symbol. Avoid using graphical images of text in buttons,
	unless there is an exceptional circumstance such as in a bold, italic, or font-sizing button
	.</p>
