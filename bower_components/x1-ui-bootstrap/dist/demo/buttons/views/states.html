<h2 class="page-header">States</h2>
<h4>The following states are available in both mobile and non-mobile environments:</h4>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
	<dt>Enabled (active)</dt>
	<dd>An enabled button is a button that a user can act on.</dd>
	<dt>Disabled (inactive)</dt>
	<dd>A disabled button is a button that a user can't act on.</dd>
	<dt>Selected</dt>
	<dd>A button is selected when the user presses and holds the mouse button while the cursor is
		on the button (non-mobile environment) or pushes and holds on the button (mobile
		environment).</dd>
	<dt>Hover</dt>
	<dd>A button is in a <strong>hover</strong> state when the mouse or user's finger moves over
		it. This state is not available on all mobile OS platforms and devices.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>These states apply to non-mobile devices:</h4>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
	<dt>Default</dt>
	<dd>A default button is the one that initially has focus. There is no distinct visual to
		identify the default.</dd>
	<dt>Focus</dt>
	<dd>A button other than the default button gains focus when the user navigates to it using
		the keyboard. The button with focus will be activated when the user presses the Enter key
		or the space bar key.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each state has its own visual treatments. Multiple states are supported — for example, a
	button that is enabled (active) will additionally show a hover state when the mouse moves
	over it, while a disabled button will not.</p>
<h3>Hide, show or disable</h3>
<p><strong>Hide actions that are not applicable, unless one of the following conditions is
	true:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The user can enable it.</li>
	<li>The state is transient or temporary.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases, leave the actions enabled and provide the conditions of enablement on click.</p>
<p><strong>Always leave the following enabled, and guide the user when not applicable (for example,
	the search box could include hint text):</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Search buttons</li>
	<li>Form submission buttons (including wizards)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dynamically disable the following buttons, and modify the tooltip text in supporting
	browsers:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Toolbar buttons</li>
	<li>Nested form button</li>
</ul>
<p>It is strongly recommended that the button label be amended and the button disabled to
	acknowledge an action that the user has taken. For example, when the user clicks the Buy
	button, disable the button and change the label to Buying…</p>
