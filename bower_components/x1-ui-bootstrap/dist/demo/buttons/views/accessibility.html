<ul>
	<li>All buttons should include a label parameter (either the alt or aria-label attribute) with
		text for the button even if the showLabel parameter is set to false. This is used to
		identify the button in high contrast mode when the icon for the button will no longer be
		displayed, and it is also used to identify the button to a screen reader. This label will
		also provide content for the tooltip, where applicable.
	</li>
	<li>When the button text is accompanied by a graphic, the graphic should only have alternative
		text if the graphic provides additional information that the text does not convey. Otherwise
		the graphic should have the alternative text alt="".
	</li>
	<li>When there are primary buttons on the page, ensure the visual and keyboard design is
		harmonious. Create keyboard navigation such that it is simpler to get to the primary buttons
		than the secondary buttons. Grouping buttons can help by using one of the following
		techniques:
		<ul>
			<li>Group the primary buttons in a toolbar and the secondary buttons in one or more
				additional toolbars. Ensure the primary button toolbar is quicker to navigate to
				with the keyboard than the secondary button toolbars.
			</li>
			<li>Group each primary button along with its related secondary buttons in a toolbar in
				such a way that keyboard navigation reaches the primary button first. For example,
				in a horizontal toolbar with the primary button listed as the leftmost button (in
				left-to-right languages) or the rightmost button (in right-to-left languages).
			</li>
			<li>Grouping buttons into toolbars also improves keyboard navigation. The Tab key is
				used to navigate to each group and the arrow keys are used to navigate to the
				buttons within the group.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keyboard navigation (desktop only)</h3>

<h4>Simple button:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>For Web applications, if the simple button is not a standard HTML or Dojo Dijit button, it
		must be identified with the WAI-ARIA role="button".
	</li>
	<li>Keyboard navigation:
		<ul>
			<li>Tab - Navigate to a button</li>
			<li>Enter or space - Activate the button</li>
		</ul>

	</li>
	<li>Drop down menu button:
		<ul>
			<li>Use WAI-ARIA role="pushbutton" aria-haspopup="true".</li>
			<li>Refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/#menubutton">WAI-ARIA
				Authoring Practices menu button design pattern
				(http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/#menubutton)</a> for the correct
				accessibility markup for the menu.
			</li>
			<li>Refer to the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices menu button design pattern for the
				keyboard interaction.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Combination button:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>In Windows 7, the combination button is a standard element. For the Web, the combination
		button is manufactured by putting a simple button and a drop down menu button together into
		one widget. It can be made accessible by grouping the two buttons in a WAI-ARIA role=”group”
		where the first button is a standard button that performs the action and the second button
		is a button with ARIA role=”button” aria-haspopup=”true” to present the user with the list
		of other actions. Provide a label for the group which will be made available to the screen
		reader user and should briefly describe the purpose of the combination button. The label for
		the button group may be hidden from view by using aria-label or have a visible label
		associated with the group using aria-labelledby.
	</li>
	<li>Keyboard navigation:
		<ul>
			<li>When focus is on the first button (simple button):
				<ul>
					<li>Right arrow moves focus to the drop down menu button.</li>
					<li>Spacebar or Enter activates the action shown in the label of the button.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>When focus is on the second button (drop down menu button):
				<ul>
					<li>Left arrow moves focus to the simple button.</li>
					<li>Spacebar and Enter toggles the display of the drop down menu and focus
						remains on the button.
					</li>
					<li>Down arrow opens the drop down menu and places focus on the first menu
						item.
					</li>
					<li>If drop down menu was already open (because user pressed Spacebar or Enter),
						focus moves to the first menu item.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>When focus is on the pop-up list of actions:
				<ul>
					<li>Down arrow moves focus down the list.</li>
					<li>Up arrow moves focus up the list.</li>
					<li>Esc closes the list without performing any action. Additionally, in the case
						of a dynamic combination button, the label of the button is not updated.
					</li>
					<li>Enter performs the action and, in the case of a dynamic combination button,
						also places the label of the selected action into the simple button.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
