                    <h2>What it’s for...</h2>
                    <p>Drop-down lists are used when you need to present a set of choices to the user, the real estate is limited, and it is not important for the user to see what they've chosen or to see the choices all the time.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Use when...</h2>
                    <p>A drop-down appears below a menu title when it is selected, and remains until used or dismissed.</p>
                    <p>The list can be either mutually exclusive (only one choice allowed) or multiple-choice (items are selected via check marks until all choices are complete). The user then proceeds to another part of the interface to select further choices and/or actions.</p>
                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drop-down lists can be used in forms or as part of a drop-down or combination button.</li>
                        <li>If you have only two list items, radio buttons are a better choice.<br>
                            <strong>Exception:</strong> If the list of items can dynamically change, a drop-down list is less distracting than radio buttons.</li>
                        <li>If you have more than eight list items, a list box is a better choice.</li>
                        <li>If a user must scroll to see all the list items, you may choose to use a list box to display 8 or more options.</li>
                        <li>Unless a more natural order is appropriate, sort the list items alphabetically</li>
                        <li>If possible, provide a default, preselected choice. If you cannot do this, the default text should be "Select", "Select one", "Select a __________" (for example, Select a product), or something similar.</li>
                        <li>When possible, display the full list of choices, but if the number of items in the list exceeds the space available to present them, set the list so that it can scroll vertically and/or is re-sizable. Optionally, use a list box.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Nesting</h3>
                    <p>Drop-down lists can have nested, or sub-lists that are accessed using a twistie. The sub-lists are indented from the main list.</p>
                    <h3>Selecting</h3>
                    <p>If a drop-down list can have more than one item selected, the selected items are indicated with a check box to the right of the item. The items can then be made more easily available to the user with multiple-select tag buttons.</p>
                    <p>It may be useful to have a “Deselect all” function if it's possible for the user to select enough items that it would be time-consuming for them to deselect them one at a time.</p>
                    <h3>Label and choices</h3>
                    <p>For globalization, use leading edge to specify the placement of the drop-down list label. Note: these guidelines assume left alignment as the leading edge. However right alignment should be assumed for the leading edge, as appropriate per locale.</p>
                    <h3>Alignment</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The text in a drop-down list does not wrap. Use clear and concise items.</li>
                        <li>Avoid using horizontal scroll. If necessary, resize the drop-down list, or display the tail and the beginning of the value instead.</li>
                        <li>Sometimes expanding the drop-down list overlaps other UI elements.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>States</h2>
                    <p>A drop-down list can have these states:</p>
                    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                        <dt>Enabled</dt>
                        <dd>The user can choose from the list.</dd>
                        <dt>Disabled</dt>
                        <dd>Both the disabled list box and the label are unavailable to the user. The drop-down list cannot be selected. If an option is preselected, it is still visible in gray text.</dd>
                    </dl>
