<h2>States</h2>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>Default state</dt>
    <dd>Ensure that the default radio button is meaningful: choose the option that is most appropriate, most common, has the least risk, or is the current value. There are times when it is appropriate to have no default value.</dd>
    <dt>Selected</dt>
    <dd>If a radio button is selected, it is the default selection, or the user has selected the radio button. It is possible that an option is chosen as a result of interacting with another form element where dependencies exist.</dd>
    <dt>Unselected</dt>
    <dd>If a radio button is unselected, it is not the default selection, and was not selected by the user.</dd>
    <dt>Disabled</dt>
    <dd>If a radio button is disabled, it is one that the user cannot act on. Often times, a user must perform another action first, for example, choose a prerequisite, before this radio button is enabled. A disabled radio button can be selected or unselected. When a disabled radio button controls other UI elements, disable the dependent elements.</dd>
