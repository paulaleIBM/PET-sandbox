<h2>What they're for...</h2>

<p>A radio button is a way for a user to choose only one item from a group of items, and it is important that the user see all of the choices available.</p>

<h2>Use when...</h2>
<p>For mobile applications, radio buttons are displayed with a button-like interface to make them easier to use on small devices. These are often referred to as multi-state toggles, but they are not actually toggles, which have only two choices – on or off (see Toggles).</p>
<p>For desktop applications, radio buttons are still used to show a choice of items, where the user selects only one item.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use at least two radio buttons. Long lists of items can be overwhelming. Keep the number of radio buttons to six – eight.</li>
    <li>You can include more than eight radio buttons if there is adequate space and the user would benefit from seeing all the options at one time.</li>
    <li>However, typically if you need more than eight radio buttons, use a drop-down list because it conserves space. If you use a group of radio buttons, ensure that the user can see all the options at the same time.</li>
    <li>Place the most common or important option first.</li>
    <li>One radio button must always be selected. If none of the selections are required (no radio button is selected), include a "None" or "Not applicable" option.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Order</h3>
<p>Place the most common or important option first. However, if there is a more natural or logical ordering, use that instead. If there is no natural or logical order, list them in alphabetical order.</p>

<h3>Labels</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use a label for a group of radio buttons.</li>
    <li>Use sentence style capitalization for a group label.</li>
    <li>Do not include a colon at the end of a group label.</li>
    <li>Use sentence style capitalization for radio button labels.</li>
    </ul>
