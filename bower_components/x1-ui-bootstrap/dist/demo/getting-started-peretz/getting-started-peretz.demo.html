        <p>The IBM Commerce user experience team faced a challenge - to use the IBM Design Language to design products with these attributes:
            <ul>
            <li>Modern</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>Confident</li>
            <li>Approachable</li>
            <li>Intuitive</li>
            <li>Unified across the solution set</li>
            </ul>

        </p>
            <h2>Enter Peretz</h2>
            <p>To meet this challenge, we have created Peretz.</p>
            <p>Peretz is named after Paul Rand, born Peretz Rosenbaum, an American art director and graphic designer best known for his corporate logo designs.</p>
            <p>Peretz also means “breakthrough” in Yiddish.</p>
            <p>We hope Peretz will be a breakthrough in the usability and unity of our product portfolio.</p>

            <h2>What is Peretz?</h2>
            <p>Peretz is a multilayered design system that embodies the IBM Design Language and the IBM Commerce attributes. Although Peretz was created for IBM Commerce, anyone within IBM can use it. It comprises the following layers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Look and Feel</li>
                <li>Interaction Patterns</li>
                <li>Reusable Widgets</li>
                <li>Common Core UI Components</li>
                <li>Workflow Integration</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Interaction patterns</h2>
            <p>In software design, 'look and feel' is a term used to describe the visual and interactive aspects of a user interface.  The 'feel' describes the behavior of elements such as buttons and menus.</p>
            <h3>What is an interaction pattern?</h3>
            <p>There are a many different elements in any given user interface, and in order to make it easier and enjoyable for users to navigate and interact with our products, we must create elements that are consistent and easy to use, across all our products.</p>
            <p>Interaction design patterns are a way to provide consistent, repeatable solutions that solve common design challenges. These patterns make it easier for users to understand an interface and accomplish their task.</p>
