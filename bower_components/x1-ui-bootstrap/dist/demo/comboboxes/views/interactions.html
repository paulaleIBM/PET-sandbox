<h2>Interactions</h2>

<h3>Clicking on, touching or tabbing to the text field</h3>
<ul>
<li>When the user clicks on, touches, or tabs to, the text field part of the combo box, focus is set with all the current text selected, so the user can start typing immediately to replace existing text. </li>
<li>For a combo box with a drop down list, as the user enters text, the drop down list opens and shows the list of potential matches and highlights the first match. The opened list closes if the user continues to type letters and there are no longer any potential matches. If there is never a match, the list does not open. If the list is always displayed, no highlight selector is shown until a match is found.  The items in the drop down filter use the same rules as auto-complete. Auto-complete involves the program predicting a word(s) that the user wants to type in without the user actually typing it in completely. </li>
<li>Until the user highlights a particular choice, only the typed letters are displayed in the text field. </li>
</ul>
