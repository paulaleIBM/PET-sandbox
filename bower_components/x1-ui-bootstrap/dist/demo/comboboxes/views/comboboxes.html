<h2>What they're for...</h2>
<p>A combo box is a way to show a list of items, as well as to add an item. A combo box is a combination of a drop-down list, or a list box, and a single line text field. </p>
<h2>Use when...</h2>
<p>Use a combo box when the user needs to select one or more items from a list, and where they can add a new item to the list as well.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>A combo box is a combination of a drop-down list or a list box, and a single line text field.  
This allows the user to type a value that isn't in the list, or to choose from the list of existing options.</p>
<p>See the Drop-down, Text field, and List box guidelines for styling and blueprint information.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If space is constrained, implement the combo box with a drop-down list instead of a list box. This combination is most commonly used, to save real estate. </li>
    <li>Implement the combo boxes with a list box when space is unconstrained. This combination is less commonly used because it uses so much of the space in the window.
    The combination of list box and text field is used to encourage the user to review the alternative choices, and draw attention to an item in the list.</li>
				<li>If a user enters text that is not valid (for example, text instead of a number) you must handle the error with an error message.</li>
    <li>Ideally, the list of possible values does not exceed 30. If there are more than 30 choices, consider showing a representative sample. 
    This works well when the user can easily enter a different value. (For example, you can list the most common font sizes, and users who want to use a less common size can type it in.) 
    However, if a user might have difficulty entering the value correctly, it is better to display the full list of choices and scroll the list if needed.
</li>
</ul>

<p>On desktop applications, clicking the arrow, or using the Alt+Up/Down arrow or Up/Down arrow keys, opens the drop-down list so the user can see likely choices in advance, and a list of previous user values.</p>
<h3>Order of choices</h3>
<p>Unless a more natural order is appropriate, sort the list items alphabetically.</p>

<h3>Default choice</h3>
<p>When there is a reasonable default value, supply it initially in the text field and as selected in the list. 
When there is a single click in the text field, or when the text field receives focus, the text in the entry should automatically be selected. 
With the first character entered, the default or previous value is automatically removed. 
When there is no default value, you may use a prompt label in the text field for identifying the purpose of the combo box. 
It must not be crucial information that user needs to see while using the combo box. 
The prompt text should be in italic and in grey. It must not be confused with real text in black. Use sentence style capitalization for the prompt text. </p>

<h3>Label and choices</h3>
<p>For globalization, use leading edge to specify the placement of the combo box label. Note: these guidelines assume left alignment as the leading edge, however right alignment should be assumed for the leading edge, as appropriate per locale.</p>
<h3>Alignment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The text in a combo box does not wrap. Use clear and concise items.</li>
    <li>Avoid using horizontal scroll. If necessary, resize the list, or display the tail and the beginning of the value instead.</li>
    <li>Sometimes expanding the drop-down list overlaps other UI elements.</li>
</ul>
