# Product Design Language & UI Components: Framework (v0.1.6)

Framework is an opinionated framework to integrate your web application (or product suite) into the IBM Commerce Design Language.

## Installation Instructions:

If you want to use Framework in your project, create a bower registry file
called .bowerrc in your project root and add this config to it to point to our private bower registry.

	{
		"registry": "http://x1showcase.emmlabs.ibm.com:5678"
	}

Execute this command in your project root to install Framework.

	bower install x1-ui-ng-framework

In order to access the demo pages locally open
http://localhost/your-project-name/bower_components/x1-ui-ng-framework/dist/ assuming you have your
project in the root directory of your favorite HTTP server.

You can also access the demo pages at [X1 Showcase (Development)](http://x1showcase.emmlabs.ibm.com) to see how
to leverage Framework.
